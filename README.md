# Predictive Maintenance for Supply Chain Using TensorFlow

## Problem Statement

In modern supply chains, unexpected machinery breakdowns can lead to costly downtimes, production delays, and logistical challenges. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict machine failures before they happen. By predicting these failures, organizations can schedule maintenance proactively, reduce downtime, optimize logistics, and improve overall operational efficiency. Predictive maintenance is particularly valuable for industries that rely on machinery and logistics, such as manufacturing, warehousing, and supply chain operations.

## Business Outcomes

Reduced Downtime: By predicting machinery breakdowns, businesses can schedule maintenance in advance, reducing unplanned downtime and production losses.
Cost Efficiency: Avoiding unexpected failures reduces repair costs, allowing businesses to better allocate resources and reduce expensive emergency maintenance.
Operational Optimization: Proactive maintenance planning helps optimize supply chain logistics and resource management, resulting in smoother operations.
Increased Asset Lifespan: Regular maintenance based on machine health can extend the lifespan of machinery, further reducing capital expenses.
Improved Decision-Making: AI-powered insights help business leaders make data-driven decisions related to machinery usage and resource allocation.


## Tech Stack Used

Python: The primary language used for building, training, and deploying the model.
TensorFlow: A popular deep learning framework used to build, train, and deploy the predictive maintenance model.
Scikit-learn: Used for data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computing.
Jupyter Notebooks: Used for exploratory data analysis and model development.
Flask: A lightweight web framework to deploy the machine learning model as a web service (optional).
Power BI or Tableau: For creating visualizations and generating reports from the predictions (optional).

## Project Workflow

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Load and preprocess the Predictive Maintenance Dataset containing information such as machine characteristics, usage history, and failure logs.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
2. Model Building
Create a TensorFlow model for classification, using machine parameters and operational metrics to predict failure events.
Train and test the model on historical data.
Perform hyperparameter tuning and validation.
3. Model Deployment (Optional)
Deploy the trained model as an API using Flask to allow real-time predictions.
Create an HTML-based interface where users can input machine data and get failure predictions.


## Dataset
Dataset Description: The dataset contains 5,000 records with features such as:
Machine ID
Operational hours
Temperature
Pressure
Machine age
Failure logs (labels)
You can either create a synthetic dataset or use publicly available datasets from platforms like Kaggle. In this project, we created a synthetic dataset based on real-world attributes.

## Example Output

Predicted Output: The model will output a binary classification (0 or 1) where 1 indicates a potential failure and 0 indicates no failure.
Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data after tuning.
Dashboard: You can visualize the prediction trends using Power BI or Tableau, displaying insights like failure trends over time, machine performance, and potential downtimes.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning models can be used to improve supply chain operations by predicting failures and enabling proactive maintenance. By using AI-based predictive analytics, companies can significantly reduce downtime, optimize logistics, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
